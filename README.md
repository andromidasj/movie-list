# Movie List üçø

## ‚ùì What is it?
This is a movie list app that allows you to connect your Plex account and track the movies you've watched.

The new _Watchlist_ feature from Plex introduced a great way to keep track of all the movies you want to watch in one place, no matter which streaming service they're hosted on. Unfortunately, it doesn't allow you to keep track of (and look at) all the movies you've already watched, or allow you to create more than one list.

This is where **Movie List** comes in handy!

You can create as many movie lists as you want, and can connect a Plex account to any list using its Plex Token. You can also track movies without connecting any Plex accounts, and all the data will be stored locally.
